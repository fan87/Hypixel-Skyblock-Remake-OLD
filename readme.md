## Missing Features
Those features are not being implemented, and currently not working on them.
If you can code java or know someone who can code java, you can do
pull requests or DM me on discord to add those 
features in.
#### Systems
 - Auction (No point when you are playing with your friends/single player)
 - Bazaar (Nobody will sell/buy anything so pointless)
 - Multi Server (AKA BungeeCord Support, since I'm lazy. I'll add it, don't worry, even tho it will be very difficult to set it up)
#### Addon Support
 - Custom World Type (Lazy to make, probably will make them later)
#### Area
 - Save location and stuff to config/database (Lazy, will make it later. For now just change the sourcecode and build it)
