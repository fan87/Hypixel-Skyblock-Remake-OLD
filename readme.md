Welcome to the document! You can find more informations about this remake on this document.

## Addons System

This system allows you to create your own Hypixel SkyBlock experience, also known as Content Pack. We have some pre-made content packs for you, including commands pack, more items pack, debugging pack, plugin support pack and more!

### Pre-made addons

#### Basic Command Pack

This pack includes most commands you want, including `/craft`, `/ec` and some basic commands that's in Hypixel

#### LP SkyBlock

This pack gives the support of LuckPerm plugin, so rank system will work like Hypixel

#### Dev Client Pack

This pack includes some features you'll need to debug stuff, including Path Finding debug info, entity debug info, items debug info and more!

## Bad Performance
Performance is really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really bad. (Avg 16 TPS)<br>
Why? Cuz I want to make it expendable but epically failed.<br>
If you want to help me fixing it, you can use /pp command to get the lag source (Not the exact method name, but the event handler name). I'm lazy to make synchronize thread, so it might throw exception. Try it more times and it will work.


## Use/Disclaimer

This game is made by Hypixel, which means non of us owns the game, and able to make profit. Most likely you are allowed to use this plugin in a small private server, but Hypixel still has the permission to take your server down, or even take the repository down.



## Missing Features / Not planned to make

Those features are not being implemented, and currently not working on them.
If you can code java or know someone who can code java, you can do
pull requests or DM me on discord to add those
features in.

#### Systems

- Auction (No point when you are playing with your friends/single player)
- Bazaar (Nobody will sell/buy anything so pointless)
- Multi Server (AKA BungeeCord Support, since I'm lazy. I'll add it, don't worry, even tho it will be very difficult to set it up)

#### Addon Support

- Custom World Type (Lazy to make, probably will make them later)

#### Area

- Save location and stuff to config/database (Lazy, will make it later. For now just change the sourcecode and build it)

## Installation
Full Install gulde coming soon! If you want to test out this plugin, contact me on Discord, and I'll teach you. You won't be able to figure it out yourself unless you read the source code.


## API

We have an API that allows you to add your own commands, items, blocks, mobs etc into the game! If you are a developer, and you would like to make your own addon, please check out our [Addons API Document](https://github.com/fan87/Hypixel-Skyblock-Remake/blob/master/document/api/GettingStarted.md).
